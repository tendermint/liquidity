      `MsgWithdrawWithinBatch` defines an `sdk.Msg` type that submits a withdraw
      request to the liquidity pool batch

      Withdraw submit to the batch from the Liquidity pool with the specified
      `pool_id`, `pool_coin` of the pool

      this requests are stacked in the batch of the liquidity pool, not
      immediately processed and

      processed in the `endblock` at once with other requests.

              the `pool_id`, `swap_type_id`,

              `demand_coin_denom` with the coin and the price you're offering

              The `offer_coin_fee` must be half of the offer coin amount *
              current `params.swap_fee_rate` for reservation to pay fees

              This request is added to the pool and executed at the end of the
              batch (`endblock`)

              You must submit the request using the same fields as the pool

              Only the default `swap_type_id`1 is supported

              The detailed swap algorithm is shown here.

          `pool_id`, `swap_type_id`,

          `demand_coin_denom` with the coin and the price you're offering

          The `offer_coin_fee` must be half of the offer coin amount * current
          `params.swap_fee_rate` for reservation to pay fees

          This request is added to the pool and executed at the end of the batch
          (`endblock`)

          You must submit the request using the same fields as the pool

          Only the default `swap_type_id`1 is supported

          The detailed swap algorithm is shown here.
