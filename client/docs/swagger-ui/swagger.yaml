                  submitting swap offer request to the batch of the liquidity
                  pool

                  Swap offer submit to the batch to the Liquidity pool with the
                  specified the `pool_id`, `swap_type_id`,

                  `demand_coin_denom` with the coin and the price you're
                  offering and current `params.swap_fee_rate`

                  this requests are stacked in the batch of the liquidity pool,
                  not immediately processed and

                  processed in the `endblock` at once with other requests

                  You should request the same each field as the pool

                  Currently, only the default `swap_type_id`1 is available on
                  this version

                  The detailed swap algorithm can be found here.

      You should request the same each field as the pool

      Currently, only the default `swap_type_id`1 is available on this version

          `MsgSwapWithinBatch` defines an sdk.Msg type that supports submitting
          swap offer request to the batch of the liquidity pool

          Swap offer submit to the batch to the Liquidity pool with the
          specified the `pool_id`, `swap_type_id`,

          `demand_coin_denom` with the coin and the price you're offering and
          current `params.swap_fee_rate`

          this requests are stacked in the batch of the liquidity pool, not
          immediately processed and

          processed in the `endblock` at once with other requests

          You should request the same each field as the pool

          Currently, only the default `swap_type_id`1 is available on this
          version

          The detailed swap algorithm can be found here.

              `MsgSwapWithinBatch` defines an sdk.Msg type that supports
              submitting swap offer request to the batch of the liquidity pool

              Swap offer submit to the batch to the Liquidity pool with the
              specified the `pool_id`, `swap_type_id`,

              `demand_coin_denom` with the coin and the price you're offering
              and current `params.swap_fee_rate`

              this requests are stacked in the batch of the liquidity pool, not
              immediately processed and

              processed in the `endblock` at once with other requests

              You should request the same each field as the pool

              Currently, only the default `swap_type_id`1 is available on this
              version

              The detailed swap algorithm can be found here.

          `MsgSwapWithinBatch` defines an sdk.Msg type that supports submitting
          swap offer request to the batch of the liquidity pool

          Swap offer submit to the batch to the Liquidity pool with the
          specified the `pool_id`, `swap_type_id`,

          `demand_coin_denom` with the coin and the price you're offering and
          current `params.swap_fee_rate`

          this requests are stacked in the batch of the liquidity pool, not
          immediately processed and

          processed in the `endblock` at once with other requests

          You should request the same each field as the pool

          Currently, only the default `swap_type_id`1 is available on this
          version

          The detailed swap algorithm can be found here.
