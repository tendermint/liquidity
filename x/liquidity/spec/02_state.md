# State

## Pool

`Pool` defines the liquidity pool that contains pool information

```go
type Pool struct {
	Id                     uint64         // index of this liquidity pool
	TypeId                 uint32         // pool type of this liquidity pool
	ReserveCoinDenoms      []string       // list of reserve coin denoms for this liquidity pool
	ReserveAccountAddress  string         // reserve account address for this liquidity pool to store reserve coins
	PoolCoinDenom          string         // denom of pool coin for this liquidity pool
	SwapFeeRate            string         // pool swap fee rate set by pool governor
	PoolGovernorAddress    string         // pool governor address
}
```

Pool: `0x11 | Id -> amino(Pool)`

PoolByReserveAccIndex: `0x12 | ReserveAcc -> nil`

GlobalLiquidityPoolIdKey: `[]byte("globalLiquidityPoolId")`

ModuleName, RouterKey, StoreKey, QuerierRoute: `liquidity`

PoolCoinDenomPrefix: `pool`

## PoolBatch

`PoolBatch` defines the batch(es) of a given liquidity pool that contains indexes of deposit / withdraw / swap messages. Index param increments by 1 if the pool id is same.

```go
type PoolBatch struct {
	PoolId           uint64  // id of target liquidity pool
	Index            uint64  // index of this batch
	BeginHeight      uint64  // height where this batch is begun
	DepositMsgIndex  uint64  // last index of DepositMsgStates
	WithdrawMsgIndex uint64  // last index of WithdrawMsgStates
	SwapMsgIndex     uint64  // last index of SwapMsgStates
	Executed         bool    // true if executed, false if not executed yet
}
```

## Batch Msg States

`DepositMsgState` defines the state of deposit message that contains state information as it is processed in the next batch(s)

```go
type DepositMsgState struct {
	MsgHeight  uint64 // height where this message is appended to the batch
	MsgIndex   uint64 // index of this deposit message in this liquidity pool
	Executed   bool   // true if executed on this batch, false if not executed yet
	Succeeded  bool   // true if executed successfully on this batch, false if failed
	ToBeDelete bool   // true if ready to be deleted on kvstore, false if not ready to be deleted
	Msg        MsgDepositWithinBatch
}
```

`WithdrawMsgState` defines the state of withdraw message that contains state information as it is processed in the next batch(s)

```go
type WithdrawMsgState struct {
	MsgHeight  uint64 // height where this message is appended to the batch
	MsgIndex   uint64 // index of this withdraw message in this liquidity pool
	Executed   bool   // true if executed on this batch, false if not executed yet
	Succeeded  bool   // true if executed successfully on this batch, false if failed
	ToBeDelete bool   // true if ready to be deleted on kvstore, false if not ready to be deleted
	Msg        MsgWithdrawWithinBatch
}
```

`SwapMsgState` defines the state of swap message that contains state information as it is processed in the next batch(s)

```go
type SwapMsgState struct {
	MsgHeight          uint64 // height where this message is appended to the batch
	MsgIndex           uint64 // index of this swap message in this liquidity pool
	Executed           bool   // true if executed on this batch, false if not executed yet
	Succeeded          bool   // true if executed successfully on this batch, false if failed
	ToBeDelete         bool   // true if ready to be deleted on kvstore, false if not ready to be deleted
	OrderExpiryHeight  int64  // swap orders are cancelled when current height is equal or higher than ExpiryHeight
	ExchangedOfferCoin sdk.Coin // offer coin exchanged until now
	RemainingOfferCoin sdk.Coin // offer coin currently remaining to be exchanged
	Msg                MsgSwapWithinBatch
}
```
